# Advoidment-Remake
This is the repository for the remake of Advoidment

## What is Advoidment?
The original Advoidment was a game I worked on back in the spring semester of 2023 for my Casual Game Development class with three other students. It was a simple game where you had to click on a bagel as much as you can, but ads would get in the way, and you had to complete them in order to keep clicking. The game was made in about 3-4 months.

## Why the remake?
Ever since graduating college, I felt like it would be interesting to remake games I made/helped work on while in school. This is for a few reasons. One, I feel like these games would be better if they weren't developed under strict deadlines. Two, I want to challenge myself in remaking games made in teams by myself. Three, I want to see how far my skills in game design have come along since first working on these projects. Finally, I would like to add new additions to make these games feel more complete. It is worth noting that I am the only one working on the remake, none of the other developers from the original are involved. The original Advoidment will still be available.

## What is preserved/not preserved in the remake?
I did refer to the original code when developing the remake. Since I have improved as a programmer since working on the original, the new code is much more optimized. I made sure not to simply copy and paste the old code, escpecially code that was not written by me originally. My main job in the original was programming the minigames, so a lot of the code there was brought over.
<br><br>Anything that was not created by me originally will not be used in the remake. This mostly refers to all the art assets, which I had very little hand in creating. Since I am the sole developer of the remake, it would feel wrong to use work made by others. Also, the few minigames in the original not coded by me (2/7) will not be returning.

## What are the new additions?
There will be a ton of new minigames. The original had six, while I am aiming for at least ten. I am also adding modifiers to the minigames, such as them moving around the screen and scaling constantly. All of the art assets will be new. There will also be music and sound effects.
